The ignews blog is a monthly subscription service that gives you access to some posts about web development using ReactJS framework.
As part of a study application from Ignite bootcamp developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), this blog has been built in order to learn, implement and practice some `NextJS` features such as **SSR**, **SSG** and integration with third part services.
In this project, we've integrated with GitHub Ouath so that create an authentication.
Also, this blog has integration with **FaunaDB** (Serverless NoSQL DB), **Stripe** (Payment API) and **Prismic CMS** (headless CMS to manage the posts content).
Besides those integration, it was the first time I've worked with webhooks in order to check if the current session has a authenticated user with an active subscription.

Here is the [UI](https://www.figma.com/file/gl0fHkQgvaUfXNjuwGtDDs/ig.news?node-id=1%3A2).
